### Funki Chain - Not another Chain

Introducing Funki Chain, where the magic of having fun online transforms into having fun onchain. Heavily inspired by the ethos of Disney and Japanese culture, Funki Chain reimagines the blockchain experience as an interconnected world brimming with wonder, adventure, and fun! 

Here, every interaction goes beyond mere technology; it becomes an experience. Every transaction, every game, and every digital asset is a chapter in an unfolding story designed to bring fun and excitement to your onchain activities. In the world of Funki Chain, inspired by Brian Armstrong’s "onchain is the new online," we strive to create a vibrant realm where your digital onchain actions are infused with the fun and magic of an animated ‘wonderland’, with every interaction creating a memorable, tracable and sharable adventure. With Funki, “having fun onchain is the new fun online”

We are dedicated to turning web3 innovations into everyday casual & fun experiences. You are not just to merely interact the onchain network but to be an active, celebrated part of it. Here, the blockchain isn't just a technology; instead, it’s a interconnected, living, breathing celebration of creativity, community, and fun. 

We strive to transform everyday onchain interactions through games and applicatios into extraordinary events, and rediscover the excitement of being part of a community where fun comes first, memes and pachinkos included.

Funki chain is an L2 Ethereum Rollup Network, powered by the OP Stack, part of the Superchain, leveraging OP Plasma Mode and secured by Ethereum. Apart from **fun, we value simplicity**, **pragmatism**, **sustainability**, and, of course, **optimism.**

*Funki is a fun first L2 that aim to reward users and builders for making onchain fun, again.*

### Fun for creators. Fun for builders

For creators and builders, access an ecosystem where NFTs currently only existed as boring veblen goods, can have their Doraemon’s Dokodemo (Anywhere] moment, having their multiverse selves in different fun onchain experience, all connected back to the canonical NFT. Royalties are enforced and simplified Dokodemo Protocol, a Funki’s innovative approach for NFT replications.

Funki also shares of sequencer fees to the Fun First Society (FFS) which we'll reveal more details on later.

### Contributing to the OP Superchain

Funki is powered by the OP Stack, in collaboration with Optimism. We aim to contribute to growing Optimism's Superchain ecosystem as the innovative Web3 Gaming & Entertainment Hub
