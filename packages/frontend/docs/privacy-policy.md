# 4. DATA SECURITY

FUNKI is committed to the protection of your personal information and has instituted a range of security measures aimed at safeguarding your data from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, alteration, and disclosure. These measures include, but are not limited to, encryption technologies, firewalls, and secure server facilities. Our security protocols are designed to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of your personal information during storage, processing, and transmission.

Despite our efforts to provide a secure and reliable environment for your personal information, it is important to acknowledge that no system of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Similarly, while the blockchain provides unique security features, it is not impervious to all security threats. Therefore, we cannot guarantee absolute security for your personal information transmitted to or through our Services, nor can we ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us over the Internet, including the use of email.

To further enhance data security, we also take measures to ensure that our service providers who may have access to your personal information are contractually obligated to keep such information confidential and secure, and they are not permitted to use it for any purpose other than to carry out the services they are performing for FUNKI.

We encourage you to take steps to protect against unauthorized access to your account and personal information by, among other things, choosing a robust password that nobody else knows or can easily guess and keeping your log-in and password private. We are not responsible for any lost, stolen, or compromised passwords, or for any activity on your account via unauthorized password activity.

Please be aware that you play a vital role in protecting your own personal information. When registering with our Services, it is important to choose an account password of sufficient length and complexity, to not reveal this password to any third parties, and to immediately notify us if you become aware of any unauthorized access to or use of your account.
In the unfortunate event that your personal information is compromised, we will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.

# 5. YOUR CHOICES

To do so, simply log into your account on our Services and navigate to the account settings page, where you can make the desired changes to your account information. It is important to keep your personal information accurate and up-to-date, and we encourage you to review your information regularly to ensure that it reflects your current preferences and circumstances.

These files are sent to your browser from a website and stored on your device. In addition to cookies, we utilize various tracking technologies, including beacons, tags, and scripts, to collect and track information, thereby enhancing and analyzing Services. You have the option to instruct your browser to refuse all cookies or to notify you when a cookie is being sent. However, please note that if you do not accept cookies, you may not be able to utilize certain portions of the Services.
