# Hardhat

Hardhat is an Ethereum development environment for flexible, extensible, and fast smart contract development.

You can use Hardhat to edit, compile, debug, and deploy your smart contracts to Funki.

# Using Hardhat with Funki

To configure [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) to deploy smart contracts to Funki, update your projectâ€™s `hardhat.config.ts` file by adding Funki as a network:

```typescript
networks: {
   // for mainnet
   "funki-mainnet": {
     url: 'https://rpc-mainnet.funkichain.com',
     accounts: [process.env.PRIVATE_KEY as string],
     gasPrice: 1000000000,
   },
   // for Sepolia testnet
   "funki-sepolia": {
     url: "https://sepolia-sandbox.funkichain.com/",
     accounts: [process.env.PRIVATE_KEY as string]
     gasPrice: 1000000000,
   },
   // for local dev environment
   "funki-local": {
     url: "http://localhost:8545",
     accounts: [process.env.PRIVATE_KEY as string],
     gasPrice: 1000000000,
   },
 },
 defaultNetwork: "funki-local",
```
