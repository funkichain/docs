## Funki Bridge (Testnet)

The [Funki Bridge](https://sepolia-swap.funkichain.com/) for testnet allows you to bridge ETH and certain ERC-20s from Ethereum Sepolia to Funki Sepolia and vice versa.

To bridge to or from Funki Sepolia:

1. Visit [Funki Bridge](https://sepolia-swap.funkichain.com/)
2. Click **Connect wallet**
3. Connect your wallet
4. Choose the amount of ETH (or the asset of your choice that's available) you'd like to deposit or withdraw

<!-- ## Programmatic Bridging

See the [sample code repository](https://github.com/base-org/guides/tree/main/bridge/native) to see how to bridge ETH and ERC-20s from Ethereum Sepolia to Funki Sepolia. -->

:::caution

**Double check the token address for ERC-20s** You can use any ERC-20 that is
supported on the network. You can check what assets are on Funki Sepolia and the
corresponding contract address via [this hub](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/tree/master/data).
<!-- Ensure there is an address for `base-sepolia`, [example](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/blob/master/data/WETH/data.json#L19-L21). -->
Always test with small amounts to ensure the system is working as expected.

:::

:::caution
This implementation only can bridge assets to Funki. Do not attempt to alter the
code to withdraw the assets.
