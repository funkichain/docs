### **1. What is Funki Native Bridge**

- Funki Native Bridge is only available for bridging SIPHER, USDT, ETH from Ethereum mainnet to Funki Chain.
- Native bridge is a great option for moving larger token amounts. But when moving small amounts, the gas costs for the transactions can sometimes add up, making it too expensive. For bridging smaller amounts we recommend choosing a different route, either Relay or Superbridge if available.
- When using Native Bridge, a minimum 7-day challenge period is required to withdraw funds to Ethereum.

Here’s some of the benefits of using the Native Bridge 

- You get the canonical, native asset on the destination chain.
- There are no extra fees imposed
- It’s generally the most secure form of bridging, because by using the Native Bridge you have the same trust assumptions as using the rollup itself

### 2. Native Bridge Fees & charges 

- We do not add extra fees for Native Bridge.
- However, normal network fees (gas fees) still apply.

**Please note:**


> Bridging from Ethereum mainnet to a Settlement Chain (like Funki) requires multiple transactions. So network fees can add up. When bridging smaller amounts, it might be worth considering an alternate bridge route to save on network fees.


### **3. How to bridge assets from Ethereum mainnet to Funki Chain on Funki Native Bridge (Deposit)**

- **Step 1 — Connect your wallet**

Be sure your wallet supports all Chains & Funki Chain mainnet you will be bridging onto.

- **Step 2 — Select a token to bridge**

Select the token you wish to bridge, and enter the amount.


Funki Native Bridge is only available for bridging SIPHER, USDT, ETH from Ethereum mainnet to Funki Chain.

- **Step 3 — Review your bridge**

Tap the _Review Bridge_ button and review your bridge details.


Please note the approximate transaction cost, and bridging time.


![Screenshot_2024-12-17_at_10.49.26.png](/15f2701f826d80b493ebd2884bcc9fb0/Screenshot_2024-12-17_at_10.49.26.png)


To proceed check the boxes indicating you understand the following:

- The approximate time that the bridge will take.
- That the indicated network fees for each step are approximate and are subject to change depending on network activity.
- That you cannot cancel or reverse a bridge once it has been started.
- **Step 4 — Start your bridge**

Depending on the token, you may need to approve it first. This is so the bridge contract can use your funds for bridging. Note that we only request an approval for the amount you're bridging, this helps secure your wallet in case the bridge contracts are compromised.


Next, start your bridge and continue with the transaction in your wallet.

Once the transaction is successful, all you need to do is wait a for approximately the indicated time and your tokens will arrive on the chain! Each Rollup differs in how long this takes, but generally we see these bridges clearing in 2 to 10 minutes.

### **4. How to bridge assets from Funki Chain to Ethereum Mainnet on Funki Native Bridge (withdraw)**

- Bridging off assets from Funki to Ethereum Mainnet on Funki Native Bridge is a multi-step process and requires multiple transactions. There is also a significant wait period (usually 7 days).
- Please note:
Native bridge is a great option for moving larger token amounts. But when moving small amounts, the gas costs for the transactions can sometimes add up, making it too expensive. For bridging smaller amounts we recommend choosing a different route, like Relay if available.

**Step 1 — Connect your wallet**

	- **Wait for the Challenge Period**
	- The Challenge Period is a security measure built into the Native Bridge contracts for Optimism and other L2s based on Optimism like Funki. You will need to wait for the designated period of time before continuing with your bridge. The Challenge Period usually takes 7 days.
	- Please check this progress bar often. There are some stages need your action to execute.

		1: Waiting Prove


		2: Ready to Prove 


		3: Proved


		4: Waiting Finalize


		5: Finalized


### **5. Alternative bridges**

- You can use Superbridge - a powered the Native Bridge contracts for official Superchain rollup blockchains to bridge assets from other L2s to Funki
- Or you can use Relay - a instant, low-cost bridging and cross-chain execution to bridge ETH, USDT, $SIPHER from Ethereum mainnet and Solana & other L2s to Funki
