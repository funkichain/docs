### 1. Introduction and Acceptance

GIN Management Company Limited ("**FUNKI**", "**we**", "**our**" or "**us**") hereby offers you, the user, the opportunity to engage with our comprehensive array of blockchain-related services (collectively, the "Services"), which encompass the following components:

- The FUNKI Protocol, which facilitates user engagement by providing a streamlined mechanism for processing transactions on the Ethereum network, enabling the exchange of data between the Ethereum blockchain and the FUNKI Mainnet, as well as offering a platform for interaction with an assortment of smart contract applications that are deployed on the FUNKI Mainnet.
- The FUNKI Gateway Interface, a sophisticated web-based portal designed to allow users to seamlessly connect a compatible non-custodial software wallet, herein referred to as a "**Web3 Wallet**", which serves as a conduit for initiating transactions on the FUNKI Mainnet and for transferring digital assets across various blockchains, including Ethereum and FUNKI Mainnet, as well as interoperating with other blockchains through integrations with third-party bridge services.
- The FUNKI NFT Service, a specialized offering that enables qualified participants to mint non-fungible tokens, known as Replica NFTs, on the FUNKI Mainnet, complete with customizable attributes, herein referred to as "**Attributes**". These Replica NFTs are indelibly associated with the user's wallet address and are designed to be transferrable, facilitating their utilization within decentralized applications that operate on the FUNKI Mainnet.
- The FUNKI Marketplace, an online platform engineered to facilitate the exchange of NFTs between buyers and sellers. While FUNKI acts as the host for the marketplace and manages the processing of payments, it is important to note that FUNKI does not assume the role of a contracting party in any agreements that may arise between users within the marketplace. Users are solely responsible for the payment of all taxes, as defined and imposed by any relevant governmental authority, in connection with their utilization of the platform. This includes, but is not limited to, any taxes levied on the acquisition, ownership, or transfer of NFTs.
- Connectivity options that allow for integration with select third-party services and decentralized applications (collectively referred to as "**Third-Party Services**" or "**Dapps**"), which are made accessible through the FUNKI Gateway Interface. It is imperative to acknowledge that the use of these Third-Party Services is governed by their own respective terms and conditions

Please be aware that FUNKI reserves the exclusive right to revise or modify these Terms at any time, in accordance with our sole discretion.

### 7. Intellectual Property Rights

The Services, including the FUNKI Protocol, Gateway Interface, NFT Service, Marketplace, and all underlying technology, software, algorithms, user interfaces, graphics, logos, designs, text, images, and other content ("FUNKI Content") are the proprietary property of FUNKI, its affiliates, partners, licensors, or other content providers. The compilation of all FUNKI Content is the exclusive property of FUNKI and is protected by intellectual property laws.

- Limited License: The Terms grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, and revocable license to access and use the Services strictly for your personal, non-commercial purposes. This license is subject to your full compliance with these Terms and does not include any right to:
  - Sell, resell, or use commercially the Services or any Content;

  - Make derivative uses of the Services or any Content;

All rights associated with the NFTs, including rights to any underlying digital content or data linked to the NFTs, are retained by the respective rights holders, creators, or as specified in the NFT metadata and smart contracts deployed by third parties.
- License Grant to FUNKI: By listing or selling NFTs on the FUNKI Marketplace, you grant FUNKI a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use, copy, transmit, distribute, publicly display, and make derivative works of any content and metadata associated with your listed NFTs, solely for the purpose of operating, promoting, and improving the FUNKI Marketplace and Services.
- Third-Party Content: The FUNKI Marketplace may contain or interact with third-party content, applications, or services. FUNKI does not control and is not responsible for such third-party content.

### 8. Dispute Resolution

In the event of any dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of or in connection with these Terms, or the breach, termination, or invalidity thereof (collectively, "**Disputes**"), you and FUNKI agree to seek resolution exclusively through final and binding arbitration, rather than in court. The arbitration shall be conducted in accordance with the Arbitration Rules of the British Virgin Islands International Arbitration Centre ("**BVI IAC**"), which Rules are deemed to be incorporated by reference into this clause. The tribunal will consist of a single arbitrator to be appointed in accordance with the BVI IAC Rules. The place of arbitration shall be Road Town, Tortola, British Virgin Islands, unless both parties agree in writing to an alternative location. The language of the arbitration shall be English.

By agreeing to arbitration, you understand and agree that you are waiving your rights to maintain other available dispute resolution processes, such as a court action or administrative proceeding, to settle disputes. Furthermore, you agree to waive any right to a jury trial and the right to participate in any class action lawsuit or class-wide arbitration. Any arbitration under these Terms will take place on an individual basis; class arbitrations and class actions are not permitted, and by entering into these Terms, you are giving up the ability to participate in a class action.

The arbitrator's decision shall be final and binding and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction. Notwithstanding the foregoing, FUNKI may seek and obtain injunctive relief in any jurisdiction in any court of competent jurisdiction.

### 9. Miscellaneous

These Terms, including any legal notices and disclaimers contained on the Services, constitute the entire agreement between you and FUNKI concerning your use of the Services. These Terms supersede all prior agreements, understandings, negotiations, and discussions, whether oral or written, between the parties. No amendment or modification of these Terms will be effective unless in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of FUNKI.

If any provision of these Terms is held by a court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable for any reason, such provision shall be eliminated or limited to the minimum extent such that the remaining provisions of the Terms will continue in full force and effect. The failure of FUNKI to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms shall not operate as a waiver of such right or provision.

FUNKI reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to modify, amend, or replace any part of these Terms at any time. It is your responsibility to check these Terms periodically for changes. Your continued use of or access to the Services following the posting of any changes to these Terms constitutes acceptance of those changes. FUNKI may also, in the future, offer new services and/or features through the Services (including the release of new tools and resources). Such new features and/or services shall be subject to the terms and conditions of these Terms.

If FUNKI makes changes that are deemed material, it will provide you with notice as appropriate under the circumstances, such as by displaying a prominent notice within the Services or by sending you an email. FUNKI will determine, in its sole discretion, what constitutes a material change.
