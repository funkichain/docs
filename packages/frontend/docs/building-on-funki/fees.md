## How do network fees on Funki work?

Every transaction on Funki involves two types of costs: an L2 (execution) fee and an L1 (security) fee. The L2 fee covers the cost of executing your transaction on the L2 network, while the L1 fee represents the estimated cost to record the transaction on the Ethereum L1. Typically, the L1 security fee is higher than the L2 execution fee.

The L1 fee fluctuates based on the current traffic on Ethereum L1. If your transaction timing is flexible, you can reduce costs by initiating transactions when Ethereum's gas prices are lower, such as during weekends.

Likewise, the L2 fee adjusts based on the volume of transactions being processed on the L2, similar to the dynamic mechanism used on Ethereum L1.
