# Differences between Ethereum and Funki

Funki is built on the [Bedrock](https://stack.optimism.io/docs/releases/bedrock/explainer/) release of the [OP Stack](https://stack.optimism.io/), meticulously engineered to mimic Ethereum's architecture as closely as possible. This similarity ensures that developers experience minimal differences when building on Funki compared to Ethereum.

Nonetheless, there are still slight variances in how Funki and Ethereum operate, which developers should note when creating applications on Funki.

These minor differences include:

- [Opcodes](https://stack.optimism.io/docs/releases/bedrock/differences/#opcode-differences)
- [Blocks](https://stack.optimism.io/docs/releases/bedrock/differences/#blocks)
- [Network specifications](https://stack.optimism.io/docs/releases/bedrock/differences/#network-specifications)
- [Transaction costs](https://stack.optimism.io/docs/releases/bedrock/differences/#transaction-costs)
