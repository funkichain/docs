### What is Funki Bridge?

Funki Bridge enables the transfer of certain digital assets and other data back and forth between Ethereum and Funki.

### What wallet can I use?

You can use popular Ethereum wallets like MetaMask, and Rainbow Wallet to name a few.

<!-- ### What if I have a question, issue or problem?

The [Funki Discord](https://discord.com/invite/playSIPHER) community is available around the clock for general questions, assistance and support! Depending on your issue, you can create a support ticket in the `#general-support` or `#developer-support` channels. -->

### How do you withdraw from Funki?

Connect your wallet and confirm that it is set to Funki network. Choose the digital asset you wish to bridge back to Ethereum mainnet and confirm you want to withdraw.

After your withdrawal request is proposed onchain (within an hour), you must verify and complete the transaction in order to access your funds. You can track your progress under the transaction tab.

Transferring from Funki to Ethereum takes approximately 7 days. This is a security feature designed to help secure Funki. If you prefer not to wait, you can alternatively use a third-party bridge, which allows you to transfer assets much faster.
